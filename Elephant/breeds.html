          The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) weighs about 5,500 kg and has a
          shoulder height of up to 3.5 metres. The Asian elephant includes three
          subspecies: the Indian, or mainland (E. maximus indicus), the Sumatran
          (E. maximus sumatranus), and the Sri Lankan (E. maximus maximus).
          African elephants have much larger ears, which are used to dissipate
          body heat.

          The African savanna, or bush, elephant (Loxodonta africana) weighs up
          to 8,000 kg (9 tons) and stands 3 to 4 metres (10 to 13 feet) at the
          shoulder. The African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), which
          lives in rainforests, was recognized as a separate species in 2000 and
          is smaller than the savanna elephant. It has slender,
          downward-pointing tusks. The common belief that there existed “pygmy”
          and “water” elephants has no basis; they are probably varieties of the
          African forest elephants.
